## App

For now, This website lists games, main genres and subgenres. In future versions, users will be able to add their own items and edit and delete them. They will be able to create own lists.

The Main menu contains four buttons:
- Home (links to homepage)
- Games (opens a list of all games)
- Main genres (opens a list of all main genres)
- Subgenres (opens a list of all subgenres)

On each of these lists, the items can be opened.
